# README #

This project was made to contain all my shared code that I usually use in most of my plugins, actually all my recent plugins has this as a dependency and I use it quite a lot.

When adding any code here I try to make it as generic as possible, robust and easy to use. I may not be the most skilled programmer but I'm proud of some of the things I've made and put here, for an example, the Action Processor and the Variable Processor. The Logger and Configs aren't so big, but was one of the first thing I've added here and they really help me.

### What is this repository for? ###
 Well since I'll probably not make a lot more plugins, I thought that would be a waste of code if I kept only to myself. You may find it usefull too, and maybe improve it, that would be nice actually.

There's no main goal for this project or anything like that and nothing is documented yet, and I'll probably not document it, I know, I may sound like a douchebag, but I just wanted to have my code free for everyone who may find it, and along with this I've release all my plugins that use this core, so if you want you can take a look at those and see if you find something that helps you

I made this and the others plugins using spigot 1.5.2, that is also included in the repo, so don't worry Update it to a new version if you want.
